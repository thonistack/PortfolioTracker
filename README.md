# Portfolio Tracker
A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing and tracking investments, such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, and more.  
Data is stored locally in a JSON file for easy access and portability.

## Features
- Add new investments (e.g., stocks, crypto, etc.)
- View all investments with their total value
- Data automatically saved in `data.json`

## Installation
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
2. Clone this repository or download the `portfolio_tracker.py` file.  
3. Run the application in your terminal:

```bash
python portfolio_tracker.py
```

## Usage
Once the program starts, you will see the main menu:

Add Investment – Add a new investment entry.

View Investments – Display all investments with their total value.

Exit – Close the application.

## Example workflow:
Choose option 1 to add an investment (type, name, quantity, and purchase price).

Choose option 2 to view your full portfolio with calculated total values.

## Notes
The data.json file will be created automatically after adding your first investment.

This is a local, offline tool – no internet connection is required.
